# Simple Selector

## Universal selector

A universal selector—also known as a wildcard—matches any element.

```sh
* {
  color: hotpink;
}
```

This rule causes every HTML element on the page to have hotpink text.

## Type selector #

A type selector matches a HTML element directly.

```sh
section {
  padding: 2em;
}
```

This rule causes every `<section>` element to have 2em of padding on all sides.
